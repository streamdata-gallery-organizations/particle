description: We believe in the opportunity of the Internet of Things. We believe that,
  one day, everything will be connected. And when those connections happen, problems
  will start to disappear. Shelves will be stocked, machines will fix themselves.
  The world will quietly get better. In the meantime, we believe that the innovators
  and entrepreneurs who will create this future need help. This industry is young
  and its technology is complex. The promise of IoT is only made real when companies
  ship their products, and today the barriers are too high. Too many great ideas never
  see the light of day. So, here we are. We make it easy for our customers to build
  and deploy IoT products that solve real problems and create real value.
